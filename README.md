This repository contains a collection of my programming done in the Machine Learning course offered at Florida Institute of Technology. In this course, I completed two projects of my choice: one using supervised machine learning and one using unsupervised machine learning. Other notebooks in this repository show some of the coursework completed for assignments. For more information on the material covered in this class or assignments completed, please refer to Doctor Ryan White's repository: https://github.com/rtwhite1546/Spring-2024-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/tree/main
